A command-line utility for studying flash cards, written in Bash






Card decks are stored as two-column csv files; each record represents a card, and each field represents a side of that card.



TO DO:
- Add shuffle function with option -s
	- "sort -R" will randomly sort the lines in a file
	- Probably best implemented by conditional assignment of the $INPUT variable directed into the while loop used to read the csv file
